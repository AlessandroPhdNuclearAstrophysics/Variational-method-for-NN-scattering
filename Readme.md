A comprehensive Fortran framework for computing nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts using variational methods with different potential models.

## Overview

This project implements a variational approach to nuclear scattering calculations, providing tools to:

- Calculate phase shifts and mixing angles for nucleon-nucleon scattering
- Transform phase shifts to k²*cot(δ) format for effective range analysis
- Evaluate low-energy scattering observables and extract scattering lengths and effective ranges
- Support multiple potential models (AV14, AV18, EFT_pless)

The code handles all physical nucleon-nucleon channels, including both uncoupled (e.g., ¹S₀, ³P₀) and coupled channels (e.g., ³S₁-³D₁, ³P₂-³F₂).

## Prerequisites

## Output Files

### Phase Shift Files
Located in your specified output directory (default: `output/AV18/`):
- `delta_1S0.dat`: Phase shifts for ¹S₀ channel
- `delta_3P0.dat`: Phase shifts for ³P₀ channel
- `delta_3S1-3D1.dat`: Phase shifts and mixing angle for ³S₁-³D₁ coupled channel
- etc.

Format: `energy  delta1  [delta2  epsilon]` (columns depend on channel type)

### k²*cot(δ) Files
Generated by the transform program:
- `k2_kcotd_1S0.dat`
- `k2_kcotd_3S1.dat`
- etc.

Format: `k²  k^(2L+1)*cot(delta)`

### Analysis Files
Generated by the fitter program in the `fits/` directory:
- Effective range parameters
- Polynomial expansion coefficients

## Mathematical Background

The code implements the variational approach to scattering, which:

1. Expands the wave function in a suitable basis
2. Minimizes the functional to find phase shifts
3. Uses Laguerre polynomials as the expansion basis
4. Handles different nuclear potentials through a modular interface

### Effective Range Expansion

For uncoupled channels, the effective range expansion is implemented as:
```
k^(2L+1)cot(δ) = Σ c_i k^(2i)
```

From this expansion, we extract:
- Scattering length: a = -1/c₀
- Effective range: r_e = 2c₁

For coupled channels, mixing angles are represented by:
```
ε_J = Σ e_i k^(2(ΔL+i))
```

### Numerical Integration

The code uses several numerical integration methods:
- Block-adaptive integration for radial functions
- Gauss-Laguerre quadrature for exponentially decaying functions
- Exponentially growing grids for high resolution near the origin

## To-Do List
- [ ] Implement possibility to fit new potential models using calculating the potential radial functions once
- [ ] Implement "nn" and "pp" cases in the same way as "np" (currently only np is implemented)
- [ ] Implement the `lemp=1` option to include the electromagnetic potential in the calculations and the correct asymptotic behavior of the wave function
- [ ] Implement additional potential models (e.g., EFT_pionfull)
- [ ] Add more test cases for robustness
- [ ] Improve documentation and examples
- [ ] Optimize performance for large-scale calculations
